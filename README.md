App: New Beginnings 

Collaborated with Brian Li to create a Rails application that allows users to browse, schedule playdates and adopt shelter animals:

* Accessed a Sqlite3 database using ActiveRecord and in a test-driven environment 
* Implemented a Rails that uses an MVC structure and RESTful conventions on a single page application
* Designed 7 models with strong many to many relationships with full CRUD functionality 
* Wrote various loop mechanism for accurate results based on set conditions
