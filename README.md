# README

Collaborated with Brian Li to create a Rails application that allows users to browse, schedule playdates and adopt shelter animals.
This app was accessed a Sqlite3 database using ActiveRecord and in a test-driven environment. We also Implemented a Rails that uses an MVC structure and RESTful conventions on a single page application. For the backend, we designed 7 models with strong many to many relationships with full CRUD functionality and wrote various loop mechanism for accurate results based on set conditions.
